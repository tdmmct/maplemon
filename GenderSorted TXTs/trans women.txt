Take a left, then right at the traffic light. Go straight and take your second left, past the water fountain. The lemonade stand will be there	Take some lemons, squeeze them into a big container. Add sugar and water until it tastes good to you
Do you see the trees on your right and the house on your left? Turn left at the intersection. Now you are heading north, toward the house. Keep going north, past the house. You will pass a stoplight, where there is another intersection. Keep going north past the intersection. On your right you will see a store with a picture of a shopping cart on it. Keep going north until you see a record store on your left. Turn right at that intersection. Now you are heading east. Keep going east past the store, which is on your right, with a picture of a shopping cart on it. Past the store you will reach an intersection. Keep going east. At the dead end you will see the lemonade stand to your right. Enjoy.	Take a lemon and cut it in half, then into quarters. Get a glass and squeeze all the lemon wedges into your glass. Add three tablespoons of white sugar to the glass. Then add water to the glass until it fills the glass.  Stir with a spoon.  Enjoy.
Start by exiting your house. There is a road to the north of the forest that leads northeast. Follow that road as far as possible. At the end of the road, you will see a water fountain just above where the road stops. Continue north from the water fountain until you reach the next road. Follow that road east to arrive at the lemonade stand.	Squeeze the lemons as hard as you can, to try and extract the lemon juice. You'll want this in a separate container from the main mixture for now. Get yourself a nice little saucepan, fill it with water and put it on the stove at a nice simmer. Don't let it get too hot. Start adding sugar. How much sugar you add will determine how sweet it is. Add more for a sweeter lemonade, add less for a more sour lemonade. Once the sugar water is nice and heated up, you can pour it into a pitcher. Then add your lemon juice. Top it off with some nice cold water to chill it down, then pour yourself a good glass of lemonade. Ice optional. Enjoy!
From your house you take the road on your way you would see a street light on you right and a traffic light on your left just follow the road and you would see a house on your left and the lemonade in front.	"Slice the lemons in half.
Squeeze them into a large measuring cup. A citrus juicer or squeezer makes this process easier. There should be about 1 1/2 cups of lemon juice to make 2 quarts of lemonade.
Remove any seeds.
Combine the lemon juice and sugar, stir into the cold water. Serve over ice"
Head straight north along the street until you reach the music/record store, then head directly east along the street until you come to the lemonade stand.	Start by juicing some lemons. Take the juice from the lemons and whisk in sugar, cold water, and a pinch of salt. The amount of sugar and water will depend on how strong or sweet you like your lemonade!
Chad should follow the road by side the stream on his right , when he walks further he will now see a play ground on his left , he should continue walking towards the end of the road he will find a the lemonade stand right at the end of the road	The best way chad and make his own lemonade at home is to visit the shopping center to get the ingredients needed for it .
He should walk north from his house until he reaches the music store. Once next to the music store he should turn right and go down the east road. He should then take the first right possible. Lastly he should take the first left possible.	He should take a juicer and juice 5-18 lemons. He should then add water to fill the rest of the jug. Finally he should add sugar until it taste correctly, likely starting with 2 tablespoons of sugar.
Chad needs to set out in the direction he is facing, on the path that runs diagonally between the carnival ride and the small lake ahead of him. When he reaches the intersection at the end of this path, he should turn toward the water fountain and walk towards the street corner with it sitting there. From the water fountain, Chad should be able to see the lemonade stand, but he can also continue towards the rear of the discount shop towards a path that will take him directly to the stand.	With lemons, cut each of the lemons in half and squeeze them into a jar that can hold the juice of 10-15 lemons plus sugar. Once the lemon juice is squeezed, dispose of the lemon shells and add roughly one tablespoon of sugar per 3 lemons squeezed. Ensure that the tablespoon is a baking tablespoon and not just a spoon off of a table.
Follow the path leading to the northeast past the carousel. Cross the street to the north and keep going north past the water fountain until you rech another path. Then head east along the path to the lemonade stand.	Cut six lemons in half, then squeeze those lemons so that the juice goes into a pitcher. Add six cups of water to that pitcher, then one cup of sugar. Stir the lemon, water, and sugar until sugar is thoroughly dissolved and place into the refrigerator to cool.
First you need to walk out of your house and onto the road and co straight, past the pond and lamppost. Then you need to take a left, and keep going past the first road, and take a right at the second road. Then you need to to take a left onto the next road. Keep going and you will be at the lemonade stand.	First step is to get a large pitcher to store the lemonade. Prefill this container with ice. Next, take out your lemons, and cut them in half, then use a lemon juicer and put the lemons cut side down, and squeeze. Pour the juice into the pitcher, repeat with all of your lemons. Boil some water, and then put your sugar into the water. Pour that into the pitcher as well. Let it sit in the fridge until cool.
Make a left from your house, go all the way up the street until you see a music store. Turn right at the music store, then walk straight all the way to the lemonade stand.	Squeeze as many lemons as you'd like. Add water until you're happy with the taste, then add sugar until you like how sweet it is.
Hi Chad! Go north past the wood cabin on your left, make a right at the intersection with the circus going east, make the next possible left, then make the next possible right, then go all the way down the footpath	Take lemons, squeeze them into a container so you have pure lemon juice. Strain this into another container so there aren't solids. Dilute with water and add sugar to your taste.
Take the path in the park between the merry-go-round and the pond. You'll see a water fountain across the street. Turn right to go past the playground, and when you get to the thing made of triangles, turn left. The lemonade stand will be straight ahead of you!	Cut some lemons in half. For each half, stick a fork between the rind and the flesh and squeeze it gently towards the middle of the lemon, and repeat that all the way around the lemon, this will help you get more juice out. Put a colander over a bowl or large measuring cup and squeeze the lemon halves over it until you can't get any more juice out of them, then throw them away. The colander should have caught all the seeds, and you can throw those away too. Pour the juice into a pitcher. Add a cup or two of sugar, depending on how sweet you like it, and stir it until it dissolves. Then fill the rest of the pitcher with water and stick it into the fridge until it's cold!
Keep going on the road until it ends, continue past the bird bath and keep going, the stand will be directly in front of you.	Cut lemons in half, squeeze out the juice into a container or cup. Add water or sugar to taste.
Head north down the street. When you reach the traffic light you'll need to take a right turn. Carry on until just past the carrousel. There should be a road on your left, turn that way. Carrying on past the water fountain, there will come a dirt path on the right hand side. Turn right onto the path and the lemonade stand will be straight ahead.	Start with some lemons and cut each one in half, then put them in a lemon squeezer. Squeeze each half lemon until no more juice is coming out. Next you'll want to take the juice from the lemons and add some water to it. Add it a little at a time and continually check the taste. Finally add some sugar until it tastes just right.
Ok so see the diagonal path leading through the park. Yeah, the one the goes between the merry-go-round and the pond. Follow that to its end, and youll be near a water fountain. Looking at the water fountain your going to take a left, and then an immediate right onto the first road you pass. About halfway up that road there will be another dirt path on your left. Go down it, and the lemonade stand will be at the end.	Start by taking your lemons and cutting them lengthwise. When they are open, hand squeeze them or use a juicer until all the lemon juice comes out. Put that in the fridge for a second. Then your going to want to go to your stove and bring some water to a boil in a sauce pan. Add a little sugar and stir the water until the sugar disappears. Once that has cooled off, add the lemon juice, some cold water, and the syrup you just made and stir to combine.
Take the path between the pond and the merry go round, then go north past the water fountain until you reach the the next path, and then go right.	Squeeze lemon juice into water and add sugar.
First walk the path between the carousel and the lake until you come to the drinking fountain. Walk up the street between the fountain and the grocery store until you come to a path. Then take that path and it will lead you to the Lemonade Stand	So you want to start with 6 lemons and cut them each in half. Grab a strainer and then put it over your pitcher and squeeze each lemon of it's juice while the seeds get captured by the strainer. Remove the strainer and then measure out one cup of white sugar and add it. Then take the pitcher and fill it up with warm water from the sink.   Put it in the fridge until it's cool and then enjoy your lemonade.
At the first stop light north. Take a right/go east. Then at the water fountain, go north (take a left from where you are) then up to the dirt path go east (right) til you see the lemonade stand.	Squeeze some lemons into dish, combine sugar and water in a saucepan and warm it until they're syrup like. Get a glass of water, mix the lemon juice and syrup with it and stir.
Past the trail by the pond with the lightpost, past the grocery store should be the lemonade	"8 to 10 large lemons
1 cup of sugar
6 cups of water
Ice"
Head north along the street, past the log cabin, past the stoplight, past the grocery store, and take a right turn when you get to the record store. Continue down the street until you end up at the lemonade stand.	First, slice some lemons in half, then juice them into a pitcher. Add some sugar and mix it until it tastes as sweet as you like it. Pour all of that into a cup, add ice, and enjoy!
Cross the road in front of you, then find the dirt path that goes by the pond and carousel. When you reach the end of the path, face towards the water fountain, then turn right and follow that road. When you reach the next intersection, turn left and walk up that road. You will reach the lemonade stand a short distance away.	Take some lemons (6 should do), and cut them in half with a knife. Squeeze the juice out of them into the bottom of a large pitcher. After getting all of the juice out of the lemons, add a half cup of sugar to the pitcher. Fill the rest of the pitcher up with water, mix well with a large spoon, and refrigerate until cold.
Hello, Chad! To get to the lemonade stand from where you are, the quickest possible route would be to walk straight onto the path before you that goes diagonally. On the way, you will pass a lily pond to your right followed by a merry go round on your left. At the end of the path, you should find yourself next to a water fountain. Use the road you're standing on to walk a little north (up the street). You'll notice a store to your left. Directly across the store is where the lemonade stand is! 	I have a lemon tree in my yard, so I normally use those. But if you don't have one, you can purchase lemons from a store. I'm not sure how everyone else makes lemonade, but for me, I squeeze about 2-3 lemons into a cup that's around 16oz. I then add water until the very top. I'll add about 4 spoons of sugar. I'll need to take a sip in between to estimate whether or not it needs more. I think for me 3-4 is usually enough, but if you find that the lemonade is too bitter and not as sweet, you can add as many more spoons of sugar as you want!
Chad, you need to cross the street and head diagonally towards the carousel along the path and then cross the street towards the water fountain and continue to head the same direction to get to the lemonade stand. 	I think that if you want to make lemonade at home, you would need to get lemons, sugar, and water.  I believe that you juice the lemons and remove the seeds and then mix it with water and sugar and add ice so that you can serve it. 
Alright, Chad, here's the itinerary! A little off to the left, you can see a dirt path, that'll be your best bet. You know you're on the right track if you see a water fountain! Take a left and go right around the water fountain, then head north! Take a right once you see the dirt path, and you should see the lemonade stand right there!	To make some lemonade, all you've got to do is squeeze some lemons and put the juice into some water. After that, you can have some fun adding sugar until you've got yourself a nice refreshing glass!
Cross the path in front of you, past the pond and carousel. At the end of the path there will be a water fountain in front of you and to the left. Take the road to the left of the water fountain toward the market. About halfway down the road on the right, will be another path that will lead directly to the stand.	Start with six lemons and cut them into halves. With each half of lemon, squeeze the lemons to get as much juice out as you can. Afterward, pour the juice through a strainer to catch any seeds or pulp that may have come out with the juice. Add the juice to two cups of water, and add sugar to taste. Enjoy!
You'll see a walkway in a park. The walkway starts at the corner of two streets, east of you. You will go up this walkway, which leads north-east. You'll pass by a pond with lillypads to your right, and a carousel to your left. Once you get to another street intersection, cross the street, going the direction of a water fountain. Go left from there, and then right once you reach the next intersection. Once you reach a walkway on that street, go right and keep going until you find a lemonade stand!	Making lemonade involves squeezing lemons, or using a lemon juicer to get the liquids out of the lemonade, and then adding sugar to it. Other than that, I do not know how to make lemonade.
From your location, face forward towards the direction of the trees. Turn 90 degrees counterclockwise and walk forward until you approach the electric traffic light next to the carousel. Once at that traffic light, turn 90 degrees clockwise and walk forward until you approach the water fountain. Once you approach the water fountain, turn 90 degrees counterclockwise and then walk forward until you approach a dirt path. Once you reach the dirt path, turn 90 clockwise and walk forward on the path until you approach the lemonade stand.	Take 1 and 3/4 cups white sugar and 1 cup water and put them in a medium saucepan. Put the saucepan on the stove and apply high heat to the pan. Stir the contents in the pan until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture comes to a boil and contents thicken into a syrup. Turn off the heat and set the pan aside for later. Then take 9 lemons and cut them lengthwise in half. Squeeze the contents into a measuring cup, one big enough so the juice doesn't overflow (about a 2 cup measuring cup), until you have 1 and 1/2 cups of lemon juice and set aside. Then using a pitcher that at least holds 10 cups of water, fill that same pitcher with 7 cups of ice cold water. Take the lemon juice in the measuring cup and pour the contents into the pitcher with 7 cups of ice cold water in it. Then take the contents in the medium saucepan, the one holding the 1 and 3/4 cups of white sugar and 1 cup of water boiled into a syrup, and pour into the pitcher with 7 cups of ice cold water and 1 and 1/2 cups of lemon juice in it. Once the contents are poured into the pitcher, take a wooden spoon large enough to stir the contents inside and fit inside the pitcher, and stir the mixture until the lemon juice, ice cold water, and syrup are evenly distributed throughout the pitcher.
Chad should take the immediate road closer to his house.From his house he should face his left side(top) of the road to the first junction where the traffic light is,he should take a curve(East).As he is going,his first junction adjacent to the shopping site,he should take a left turn(north) and again another immediate junction he will meet,he should take a right turn on the east direction and just follower the footstep road to the lemonade shop.	"Preparing lemonade is quite simple and refreshing. Here's a basic recipe to help you make lemonade:

Ingredients:
- 4-6 fresh lemons
- 1 cup of sugar (adjust according to taste)
- 4 cups of water (divided)
- Ice cubes
- Lemon slices or mint leaves (optional, for garnish)

Instructions:
1. Start by juicing the lemons. Roll them on a hard surface to soften them, then cut them in half and squeeze out the juice. You can use a citrus juicer or simply squeeze them by hand. Remove any seeds that may fall into the juice.

2. In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup of water and the sugar. Heat the mixture over medium heat until the sugar dissolves completely. This creates a simple syrup that will sweeten the lemonade evenly.

3. In a pitcher, combine the freshly squeezed lemon juice, the simple syrup, and the remaining 3 cups of water. Stir well to mix all the ingredients together.

4. Taste the lemonade and adjust the sweetness or tartness by adding more sugar or lemon juice if desired. Remember that the flavors will be diluted once you add ice.

5. Add ice cubes to the pitcher to chill the lemonade or you can serve it over ice in individual glasses.

6. If desired, garnish each glass with a lemon slice or mint leaves for a fresh touch.

7. Serve the lemonade immediately and enjoy!"
Chad to get to the lemonade you can cross this intersection and follow the path through the park. After that head a bit west until you see a road that goes north and follow that until you find a dirt path on your right to the east. Follow that final dirt path and the lemonade will be yours!	"(I think too much detail is actually worse for unintelligent people)
Requirements:
Gallon Pitcher
10 Lemons
2 tablespoons of sugar
half a gallon of water

Juice your lemons into a bowl (either by cutting into two halves and squeezing or another method of your choice), removing any pulp or seeds unless you would like pulp in your lemonade. 
Put your half gallon of water into your pitcher followed by the lemon juice and sugar. After they are all combined mix with a long spoon and you will have lemonade!

Hey Chad! First, you're gonna want to go straight north from your home. When you getto the first turn available, you're gonna wanna turn on the street. It's right next to the traffic light and the carousal. Then, when you hit the next possible turn, turn left. You'll know because it's the left turn BEFORE the drinking fountain. Then, you wanna make a right onto the dirt path opposite of the grocery store. Then, just walk straight down that path and you'll be at the lemonade stand! 	Hey Chad! First, you're gonna wanna squeeze a few lemons dry of their lemon juice. If you have a juicer, use that to help drain the lemons, otherwise you'll just have to resort to squeezing out of a regular lemon. Next, get yourself a little bit of water to help blend in with the lemon juice, as the juice is too sour to be on its own. I'd recommend a cup for every half cup of lemon juice you get. Then, grab yourself some sugar, and put a tablespoon or two in, depending on how sweet you want the lemonade to taste. Mix it all together afterwards, and enjoy! 
Make a left from your house, go all the way up the street until you see a music store. Turn right at the music store, then walk straight all the way to the lemonade stand.

"First, assess your current location. Are you in a neighborhood or a commercial area? Let's assume you're in a residential neighborhood.

Start by facing north. Look for the nearest main road, Elm Street, which is about two blocks away from your current location.

Head towards Elm Street by walking straight ahead, passing a small park on your left. As you walk, you'll notice a distinctive white picket fence surrounding the park. Keep this fence on your left side as you move forward.

Once you reach Elm Street, turn right, heading east. As you walk, you'll pass a tall oak tree on the corner of Elm Street and Maple Avenue.

Continue walking on Elm Street, and after a short distance, you'll see a large blue mailbox on your left side. This serves as a landmark.

At the blue mailbox, turn left onto Oak Avenue, which is a narrow street running parallel to Elm Street.

As you walk down Oak Avenue, you'll come across a yellow house with a white porch swing on the front. This is another notable landmark that indicates you're on the right track.

Keep walking straight on Oak Avenue until you reach the intersection with Lemonade Lane. Look for a street sign with ""Lemonade Ln"" written on it.

Finally, turn right onto Lemonade Lane. As you turn, you'll immediately spot a colorful lemonade stand on the corner of Lemonade Lane and Oak Avenue. Congratulations, Chad, you've made it!"	"Ingredients:

4-6 fresh lemons
1 cup of granulated sugar
6 cups of water
Ice cubes
Utensils:

Cutting board
Knife
Juicer or citrus squeezer
Pitcher or jug
Spoon or whisk
Now, let's get started, Chad!

Begin by washing the lemons thoroughly under cool water to remove any dirt or residue. Pat them dry with a clean towel.

Place the cutting board on a flat and stable surface. Cut each lemon in half using the knife, and be careful with your fingers.

Take the juicer or citrus squeezer and extract the juice from the lemons. Squeeze each lemon half over the juicer to get as much juice as possible. Remove any seeds that may fall into the juice.

In a pitcher or jug, pour in the 1 cup of granulated sugar. This quantity can be adjusted to your taste preference. If you prefer a less sweet lemonade, you can reduce the amount of sugar.

Add about 1 cup of warm water to the pitcher. This will help dissolve the sugar easily. Stir the mixture vigorously with a spoon or whisk until the sugar is completely dissolved.

Now, pour in the freshly squeezed lemon juice into the pitcher. Make sure to strain the juice as you pour to catch any pulp or seeds.

Slowly add the remaining 5 cups of water to the pitcher, stirring continuously to combine all the ingredients thoroughly.

Taste the lemonade and adjust the sweetness or tartness according to your preference. If it's too sweet, you can add a little more lemon juice. If it's too tart, you can add a bit more sugar or water.

Once you're satisfied with the taste, it's time to chill the lemonade. You can either place the pitcher in the refrigerator for a couple of hours or add ice cubes directly to the pitcher to cool it down quickly.

Stir the lemonade well before serving to ensure the flavors are evenly distributed.

Starting from the brown house, step onto the road in front of you. Go up until you reach the traffic light. It's the light with the red light at the very top, followed by the yellow and green lights. Turn right on this road and keep going straight and just before you reach the water fountain, you want to turn up, on the road where the grocery store ends. It's next to the "buy" sign. On that road, parallel to the same "buy" sign, and to the right, is a path that leads to the lemonade stand. Keep walking on that path until you arrive.	First, you want to start with some lemons. You'll need about 10 medium lemons. You'll also need a pitcher, 12 cups of water and 1 and a half cups of sugar. Any sugar will do. Pour the water into the pitcher, then juice the lemons, being careful not to let the seeds fall into the water. Once you're done juicing the lemons, add the sugar and use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture until all of the ingredients have combined. Serve with ice and enjoy.
To get to the lemonade stand you need to follow the path straight in front of you, and keep walking past the pond and merry go round, until you reach the water fountain. After you make it to the water fountain, keep going straight the way you were, even though there is no path. You should cross a little field, and the lemonade stand should be right there in plain sight soon enough right in front of you.	You need to get some lemons, at least 3-4, and then squeeze their juice into a big pitcher where you going to make the lemonade. After you have the lemon juice squeezed in there, you want to add some water, at least 4-5 cups of water. After the water, add about 5 tablespoons of sugar to help sweeten it up. Then you're done, just mix it all up really good and you can enjoy a nice cup of lemonade.
Okay Chad, so you are going to start off by just walking a couple steps straight forward until you are on the road and then you are going to turn to your left and start walking. You'll pass another foot path on your right and a house with a red garden gnome on your left. Thats how you'll know you are going the right way. When you get to the stoplight turn right. You'll see a merry go round on your right. Take the first left you come to where you'll pass a water fountain. Finally youll come to an intersection with a store on your left and a footpath on your right, turn right onto the footpath and you'll find the lemonade stand	Take some lemons and and cut them in half. Squeeze the lemons one by one in to a pitcher of ice water. After adding five or six lemons taste the water and see if you want to add more lemon. Add sugar to taste. 
Past the trail by the pond with the lightpost, past the grocery store should be the lemonade	"8 to 10 large lemons
1 cup of sugar
6 cups of water
Ice"
Go down the dirt path and pass by the merry-go-round until you reach the road next to the water drinking station. Then continue straight down the road until the first left and you will reach the lemonade stand.	I don't know how to make lemonade at home either, sorry. At best, get some lemons, cut them in half, then squeeze them over a cup. That's probably far from correct.
From your house you are going to head northeast on the the dirt trail. You will pass a lake and a carasaol. Keep following this trail until you see a drinking fountain. You will then walk north till you see the trail again you will then follow the trail till you see the lemonade stand.	To start you first need to get 3 lemons. You will first grab a nice and cut the lemons in half. You then grab a bowl and squeeze the lemon juice out of the lemons. You will then measure out 1 cup of sugar. Place the sugar into the bowl. Then fill up two cups of water and place them into the bowl. Then using a spoon mix the lemonade. Transfer the lemonade into a cup to drink.
Cross the street and go down the path past the carousel. Go past the water fountain and you’ll be there!	Cut 5 lemons in quarters, remove the seeds, and squeeze them into a pitcher. Add a quart of water, half a cup of sugar, and ten ice cubes. Mix it all up and drink!
Chad, you will leave your place and go to the nearest intersection from your place, don't take the short cut that goes north east direction which passes the small pond and carrousel instead, turn north or turn left and go straight until you see a traffic light then turn right. Walk until you find a fountain and take a left there. On your left will be a big grocery store, and on the right, there will be a short cut road and walk through that to find a lemonade stand 	Lemons need to be washed. If you have some salt or baking soda, grab a spoonful and rub each lemon with the baking soda. Once done rubbing for a min or tow, rinse it. Next get a cutting board and a knife, and slice the lemon in half. Get a squeezer and squeeze the half and collect only juice into a cup. Put some sugar and ice and fill up the cup with still water.
You’re going to go straight like you’re walking to the music store. Once you pass the carousel, at the stop light, make a right walk to you get to the water fountain then make a left walk a little ways up then you will see a path in your right walk down the path and you are at the lemonade stand. 	To make lemon aid you will start with a really really big glass. To the glass add about halfway with water then you’re going to add a packet of lemonade mix to the water. Mix that really well till the packet is dissolved then add ice and more water till the glass of filled to the top.

You should turn left after you leave your house and get to the road. Keep going to the light and then hang a right. Go two blocks until you get to the jungle gym and then turn left and head straight until you see the lemonade stand.	After you have got 2 lemons you can use a juicer to get the juice out of the lemon by cutting them in half and then pressing the fruit side into the juicer. Once you have all of the juice tou can add sugar and water until you have a cup full and it tastes good.
You will want to take the tan path in between the pond and the carousel. That path starts at the corner of the road. Pine trees will be to your right and a stop light will be at the end of the block to your left. Once you get to the end of the path turn left until you hit the fountain and then turn right. It will be the only road on the right that you can turn on. Stay on the right side of the road until you hit another tan path. Turn right on that path and you will find the lemonade stand! 	Frist grab a pitcher or a large drinking container, pour in your lemonade mix according to the directions of how much to use, this will be poured into the pitcher, next pour 2 cups of sugar into the pitcher, fill with cold water, add ice cubes for extra coldness, stir, enjoy
Chad.  Walk south a few steps and enter the maze.  Take a right when you see the row of green trees.  After passing the six trees on your right take a left.  keep walking straight pass a driveway, then a bench, then a porta potty. After that take a right and walk past two playground pieces.  Then take a left and straight ahead is the lemonade stand.	Get a pitcher and measuring cup.  Measure four cups of water and add to pitcher.  Measure two cups of sugar to pitcher.  Get six lemons and slice in half.  Squeeze juice in pitcher and stir.  The enjoy.
Start walking straight on the dirt path that runs diagonally between the two streets. Continue walking until you reach the end. You will pass a carousel on your left and a pond on your right. When you get to the end of the path turn left and then take the first right turn at the water fountain. Walk forward until a dirt path appears on your right. Stop. Turn right towards the path. Continue forward on the path until you reach the lemonade stand. 	Take six lemons out of the refrigerator. Place them on a cutting board. Cut them across the middle. Get a pitcher down. Get two cups of sugar. Place the sugar in the pitcher. Squeeze the lemons so the juice falls in the pitcher. Fill pitcher the rest of the way with water. Put pitcher in refrigerator to cool. 
Go past the trees on your right until you see the lamp post. Turn left and you will see a picnic table. Keep going past the table and then past the park. You will see a water fountain. Turn right and then left at the next street.	Cut lemons in half. Squeeze lemons into a pitcher. Add water until the pitcher is 3/4 filled. Add 2 cups of sugar. Add ice until pitcher is totally full. Stir with a long spoon. Put in refrigerator to cool.
Head north along the street, past the log cabin, past the stoplight, past the grocery store, and take a right turn when you get to the record store. Continue down the street until you end up at the lemonade stand.	First, slice some lemons in half, then juice them into a pitcher. Add some sugar and mix it until it tastes as sweet as you like it. Pour all of that into a cup, add ice, and enjoy!
Follow the dirt path until you see the water fountain, then walk past the slide and make a left and youll be at the lemonade stand	cut lemons, juice lemons using a juicer, mix lemon juice with sugar and add water and ice
Cross the road in front of you, then find the dirt path that goes by the pond and carousel. When you reach the end of the path, face towards the water fountain, then turn right and follow that road. When you reach the next intersection, turn left and walk up that road. You will reach the lemonade stand a short distance away.	Take some lemons (6 should do), and cut them in half with a knife. Squeeze the juice out of them into the bottom of a large pitcher. After getting all of the juice out of the lemons, add a half cup of sugar to the pitcher. Fill the rest of the pitcher up with water, mix well with a large spoon, and refrigerate until cold.
To get to the lemonade stand, walk straight down the road in the direction of the stop light. When you reach the stoplight next to the merry-go-round, turn right. Walk down that street and when you see the water fountain, turn left, then walk down that road until you see the dirt path to the lemonade stand. Walk down that path to get your lemonade!	Cut 10 lemons in half with a knife. Squeeze the cut lemons in your hands over a bowl covered by a fine mesh strainer to get the juice out. Add sugar to taste, until it's nice and sweet. Pour the lemonade in a big pitcher with ice
Turn left on the street that you are currently facing. Walk one block until you get to a stoplight. By this point you will have passed an orange and white carousel. When you get to the stoplight, turn right. Walk one block. As you walk, you will pass a grocery store on your left that is having a sale. One you pass the grocery store, turn left. Once you have turned left there should be a water fountain immediately to your right. Continue walking straight until you reach an unpaved path on your right. If you come to a paved street, you have gone too far. Turn right down the unpaved path, and it leads to a lemonade stand.	Get around 10 lemons. Squeeze them until you have about 1 and 1/2 cups of juice. Set the juice aside. Next, mix 1.5 cups of sugar and 1 cup of water in a pot on the stove. Bring the pot to a boil and stir until the sugar dissolves. Set aside to cool. Get a pitcher. Add 8 cups of ice-cold water to the pitcher. Pour in the lemon juice and stir. Add a little bit of the sugar water and stir. Taste. If it's not sweet enough, add a little more of the sugar water and stir and taste again. Continue adding the sugar water a little bit at a time until it reaches the desired sweetness.
Hello, Chad! To get to the lemonade stand from where you are, the quickest possible route would be to walk straight onto the path before you that goes diagonally. On the way, you will pass a lily pond to your right followed by a merry go round on your left. At the end of the path, you should find yourself next to a water fountain. Use the road you're standing on to walk a little north (up the street). You'll notice a store to your left. Directly across the store is where the lemonade stand is! 	I have a lemon tree in my yard, so I normally use those. But if you don't have one, you can purchase lemons from a store. I'm not sure how everyone else makes lemonade, but for me, I squeeze about 2-3 lemons into a cup that's around 16oz. I then add water until the very top. I'll add about 4 spoons of sugar. I'll need to take a sip in between to estimate whether or not it needs more. I think for me 3-4 is usually enough, but if you find that the lemonade is too bitter and not as sweet, you can add as many more spoons of sugar as you want!
Chad, you need to cross the street and head diagonally towards the carousel along the path and then cross the street towards the water fountain and continue to head the same direction to get to the lemonade stand. 	I think that if you want to make lemonade at home, you would need to get lemons, sugar, and water.  I believe that you juice the lemons and remove the seeds and then mix it with water and sugar and add ice so that you can serve it. 
Alright, Chad, here's the itinerary! A little off to the left, you can see a dirt path, that'll be your best bet. You know you're on the right track if you see a water fountain! Take a left and go right around the water fountain, then head north! Take a right once you see the dirt path, and you should see the lemonade stand right there!	To make some lemonade, all you've got to do is squeeze some lemons and put the juice into some water. After that, you can have some fun adding sugar until you've got yourself a nice refreshing glass!
Cross the path in front of you, past the pond and carousel. At the end of the path there will be a water fountain in front of you and to the left. Take the road to the left of the water fountain toward the market. About halfway down the road on the right, will be another path that will lead directly to the stand.	Start with six lemons and cut them into halves. With each half of lemon, squeeze the lemons to get as much juice out as you can. Afterward, pour the juice through a strainer to catch any seeds or pulp that may have come out with the juice. Add the juice to two cups of water, and add sugar to taste. Enjoy!
You'll see a walkway in a park. The walkway starts at the corner of two streets, east of you. You will go up this walkway, which leads north-east. You'll pass by a pond with lillypads to your right, and a carousel to your left. Once you get to another street intersection, cross the street, going the direction of a water fountain. Go left from there, and then right once you reach the next intersection. Once you reach a walkway on that street, go right and keep going until you find a lemonade stand!	Making lemonade involves squeezing lemons, or using a lemon juicer to get the liquids out of the lemonade, and then adding sugar to it. Other than that, I do not know how to make lemonade.
From your location, face forward towards the direction of the trees. Turn 90 degrees counterclockwise and walk forward until you approach the electric traffic light next to the carousel. Once at that traffic light, turn 90 degrees clockwise and walk forward until you approach the water fountain. Once you approach the water fountain, turn 90 degrees counterclockwise and then walk forward until you approach a dirt path. Once you reach the dirt path, turn 90 clockwise and walk forward on the path until you approach the lemonade stand.	Take 1 and 3/4 cups white sugar and 1 cup water and put them in a medium saucepan. Put the saucepan on the stove and apply high heat to the pan. Stir the contents in the pan until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture comes to a boil and contents thicken into a syrup. Turn off the heat and set the pan aside for later. Then take 9 lemons and cut them lengthwise in half. Squeeze the contents into a measuring cup, one big enough so the juice doesn't overflow (about a 2 cup measuring cup), until you have 1 and 1/2 cups of lemon juice and set aside. Then using a pitcher that at least holds 10 cups of water, fill that same pitcher with 7 cups of ice cold water. Take the lemon juice in the measuring cup and pour the contents into the pitcher with 7 cups of ice cold water in it. Then take the contents in the medium saucepan, the one holding the 1 and 3/4 cups of white sugar and 1 cup of water boiled into a syrup, and pour into the pitcher with 7 cups of ice cold water and 1 and 1/2 cups of lemon juice in it. Once the contents are poured into the pitcher, take a wooden spoon large enough to stir the contents inside and fit inside the pitcher, and stir the mixture until the lemon juice, ice cold water, and syrup are evenly distributed throughout the pitcher.
OK Chad it to first you need to step onto the sidewalk next to your house. You should be a the intersection of the sidewalk with three concrete paths and one dirt path. Walk on the dirt path past the merry go round and pond. Once you reach the end of the dirt path, step back onto the sidewalk and face the water fountain. Turn right and walk straight until you reach the jungle gym. Turn left and walk straight, you should reach the lemonade stand! 	Cut three lemons into halves. You will need a knife and cutting board for this. Use a juicer on each lemon half then pour this juice into an empty pitcher. Once you’ve added the juice from each lemon, add 3 cups of cold water and 1 tablespoon of white sugar. Give this a good stir with a big spoon. You can put it in the fridge or have a glass with some ice. 
Head north towards the house with the garden gnome. Continue until you reach the music store, then turn right. Continue straight and you will reach the lemonade stand.	First, make sure you have 5 lemons, a gallon of water, and plenty of granulated sugar. Cut the lemons in halves and squeeze out all the juice into your water. Once all the lemons are juiced, add sugar to the mixture a little bit at a time until the lemonade is the right sweetness for your taste.
Chad should take the immediate road closer to his house.From his house he should face his left side(top) of the road to the first junction where the traffic light is,he should take a curve(East).As he is going,his first junction adjacent to the shopping site,he should take a left turn(north) and again another immediate junction he will meet,he should take a right turn on the east direction and just follower the footstep road to the lemonade shop.	"Preparing lemonade is quite simple and refreshing. Here's a basic recipe to help you make lemonade:

Ingredients:
- 4-6 fresh lemons
- 1 cup of sugar (adjust according to taste)
- 4 cups of water (divided)
- Ice cubes
- Lemon slices or mint leaves (optional, for garnish)

Instructions:
1. Start by juicing the lemons. Roll them on a hard surface to soften them, then cut them in half and squeeze out the juice. You can use a citrus juicer or simply squeeze them by hand. Remove any seeds that may fall into the juice.

2. In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup of water and the sugar. Heat the mixture over medium heat until the sugar dissolves completely. This creates a simple syrup that will sweeten the lemonade evenly.

3. In a pitcher, combine the freshly squeezed lemon juice, the simple syrup, and the remaining 3 cups of water. Stir well to mix all the ingredients together.

4. Taste the lemonade and adjust the sweetness or tartness by adding more sugar or lemon juice if desired. Remember that the flavors will be diluted once you add ice.

5. Add ice cubes to the pitcher to chill the lemonade or you can serve it over ice in individual glasses.

6. If desired, garnish each glass with a lemon slice or mint leaves for a fresh touch.

7. Serve the lemonade immediately and enjoy!"
Chad to get to the lemonade you can cross this intersection and follow the path through the park. After that head a bit west until you see a road that goes north and follow that until you find a dirt path on your right to the east. Follow that final dirt path and the lemonade will be yours!	"(I think too much detail is actually worse for unintelligent people)
Requirements:
Gallon Pitcher
10 Lemons
2 tablespoons of sugar
half a gallon of water

Juice your lemons into a bowl (either by cutting into two halves and squeezing or another method of your choice), removing any pulp or seeds unless you would like pulp in your lemonade. 
Put your half gallon of water into your pitcher followed by the lemon juice and sugar. After they are all combined mix with a long spoon and you will have lemonade!
"
from your house go straight to the road between the carousel and the pond. it is a dirt road. at the end of the dirt road you will see a water fountain. make a slight right at the water fountain to get on a paved road. walk until you get to the jungle gym. from the jungle gym turn north to get on another short paved road. at the end of the paved road you will see the lemonade stand	get 10 lemons and cut them in half. squeeze the juice out of the lemons and put them in a bowl. put 7 cups of water in the bowl as well. next melt 1.5 cups of sugar in water and mix it in with the lemon juice and water already in the bowl. don't forget to put ice in your cup as your lemonade is ready to drink.
Take the dirt path past the pond, turn right at the drinking fountain towards the jungle gym (not the porta-potty), and then take a left once you reach it. The lemonade stand will be at the end of that road.	Take lemons and use a juicer or other tool to squeeze the juice out of the lemon, into a pitcher. To that add two parts water to one part lemon juice and tablespoons of sugar to taste. (I don't know how to make lemonade, actually)
OK Chad, go straight down the road between the pine trees and the pond. When you reach the end of that road turn left and go straight down that road past the portapotty and playground. When you get to the end of that road turn left. As soon as you pass the water fountain turn right. As soon as you get to the grocery store turn right and take the trail all the way to the lemoonade stand	Alright chad. The first thing you are going to do is gather your ingredients. You'll need lemons, water,  and sugar. You'll also need a knife, a pitcher and something to stir with like a spoon. Pour all of your water into the pitcher and then add your sugar. Stir together the wter and sugar until all of the sugar is dissolved. THen you will use the knife to slice the lemons. Squeeze the lemon juice into the pitcher and stir it all together. If it's too tart add more sugar and if it's too sweet add more lemond. If you want you can add ice. Pour the lemonade into the glass ands enjoy. 
If you follow the dirt road straight, even after it tapers off, that diagonal should take you past the carousel and a water fountain, and then right up to the lemonade stand. It's basically perfectly northeast from here. Alternatively, hit north until you find the music shop, then east past the grocery and you'll come out onto a path that takes you directly to it. 	Portions are relative; as all cooking is, so feel free to experiment with your water:lemon ratio. All you really need are some lemons, water, and sugar, and you kinda just mix it together until it tastes like what you want. Juice the lemons until they can be juiced no more, add water for consistency, and add sugar to taste. It might take a bit to figure out how much of each you like, but that's sort of the joy of making stuff, isn't it?
Hey Chad! First, you're gonna want to go straight north from your home. When you getto the first turn available, you're gonna wanna turn on the street. It's right next to the traffic light and the carousal. Then, when you hit the next possible turn, turn left. You'll know because it's the left turn BEFORE the drinking fountain. Then, you wanna make a right onto the dirt path opposite of the grocery store. Then, just walk straight down that path and you'll be at the lemonade stand! 	Hey Chad! First, you're gonna wanna squeeze a few lemons dry of their lemon juice. If you have a juicer, use that to help drain the lemons, otherwise you'll just have to resort to squeezing out of a regular lemon. Next, get yourself a little bit of water to help blend in with the lemon juice, as the juice is too sour to be on its own. I'd recommend a cup for every half cup of lemon juice you get. Then, grab yourself some sugar, and put a tablespoon or two in, depending on how sweet you want the lemonade to taste. Mix it all together afterwards, and enjoy! 
make a left when you Leave your house. once you see a stoplight, make a right and follow that path until you see a water fountain, then make a left. once you see a dirt path, follow it and you will find your lemonade stand.	you wash the lemons. then you squeeze the juice onto the container. sprinkle some sugar in the juice container and the stir with a ladle and you have lemonade 
Turn left right here at this intersection and go up to the light by the carousel. Turn right at that light, then take your first left. When you come to a dirt road on the right, take it, then the lemonade stand will be at the end.	First, get some lemons. Cut them in half and then squeeze or use a juicer to get all of the juice out. Add sugar to taste. Add ice so it's cold.
Chad, you will have to go north in order to get to the lemonade stand. So as you leave your home you must walk in the north direction where you will see a carousel to your left and a pound of lilies to your right. If you end up surrounded by trees, you will have to go back from where you came from. As you pass the pond and the carousel, you should see a drinking fountain to your left and from the fountain you should be able to see the stand. Make your way to the lemonade stand. 	Start by washing 4 lemons thoroughly and then rolling them on the countertop. Cut the lemons in half, remove the seeds, and extract the juice using a juicer or by squeezing. Then dissolving 1 cup (0.24 l) of granulated sugar in 1 cup (0.24 l) of water on medium heat to create a syrup, then let it cool. In a pitcher, combine the freshly squeezed lemon juice with the cooled syrup. Add 3 cups (0.71 l) of cold water to the pitcher and adjust based on your taste preference. Chill the mixture in the refrigerator for about an hour. When ready to serve, pour the lemonade over ice in glasses and garnish with lemon slices and mint leaves if desired. 
First, head north until you reach the traffic light, then make a right. Continue straight, you should see the carousel on your righthand side. After you see a water fountain on your left, make the next left. Continue in that road until the end. You should have reached your lemonade stand now 	First you will need to gather your equipment and ingredients. You will need a large pitcher, a large mixing utensil like a wooden spoon, a packet of powdered lemonade mix, and a source of water. When you have gathered these things, you are ready to begin making lemonade. Take the powdered lemonade mix and empty it into the pitcher. Then add water until the pitcher is nearly full. Finally, use the large mixing utensil to mix the water and powder until the powder is dissolved. 
Travel northeast by following the path. You should pass by a carousel and a pond. Afterwards, you will pass a water fountain and should see the lemonade stand!	You will need lemons, water, and sugar. If possible, use a juicer to get the lemon juice of a few lemons into a small container like a bowl. If no juicer is available, you can try to squeeze the lemons into the bowl by hand. Then, strain the lemon juice to ensure you get only the juice. Combine the lemon juice with sugar and water and mix them together to get delicious lemonade!
