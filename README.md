Project MapLemon Corpus

MapLemon stats:
54000 words
346 participants
40 US states; 6 Canadian provinces
30 linguistic backgrounds
57 transgender men
84 transgender women
124 non binary people; 73 amab, 46 afab
65 cisgender women
32 cisgender men

The MapLemon corpus is completely anonymized.

The corpus is separated into sheets with genders for convenience.

Note that the pilot study does not contain answers to certain demographic
questions, so that data may be missing.

The TOTAL responses sheet includes a header with the questions answered:
Timestamp; Experiment I (Map); Experiment II (Recipe); Age; Race; Ethnicity; Gender; Biological Sex; Where are you from?; Education; Profession;
What's your first language?; What is the language you are most familiar with?; If you are bilingual, what is your second language?

The ML v6 and v5 sheets contain the responses collected from those phases.

Only the TOTAL responses sheet contains the questions as well as the
demographic stats in addition to the experiment responses.
